I have no way of knowing
if you are familiar

Yes.

This is good.

10
00:07:52,315 --> 00:07:56,402
Now, are you aware of
the job I've been ordered
to carry out in France?

11
00:07:58,738 --> 00:07:59,780
Yes.

12
00:08:00,448 --> 00:08:02,449
Please tell me
what you've heard.

13
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:04,743
I've heard

14
00:08:05,287 --> 00:08:09,582
that the Führer has put you
in charge of rounding up
the Jews left in France

15
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:12,585
who are either hiding
or passing for Gentile.

16
00:08:14,045 --> 00:08:16,922
The Führer couldn't have
said it better himself.

17
00:08:18,884 --> 00:08:22,511
But the meaning
of your visit,

18
00:08:22,971 --> 00:08:27,183
pleasant though it is,
is mysterious to me.

19
00:08:28,852 --> 00:08:32,104
The Germans looked through
my house nine months ago
for hiding Jews

20
00:08:32,189 --> 00:08:33,856
and found nothing.

21
00:08:35,609 --> 00:08:37,276
I'm aware of that.

22
00:08:37,777 --> 00:08:40,279
I've read the reports
of this area.

23
00:08:42,282 --> 00:08:45,492
But like any enterprise,
when under new management,

24
00:08:45,577 --> 00:08:48,662
there is always
a slight duplication
of efforts,

25
00:08:49,915 --> 00:08:54,585
most of it being a complete
waste of time, but needs
to be done nevertheless.

26
00:08:55,587 --> 00:08:58,631
I just have a few questions,
monsieur LaPadite.

27
00:09:00,133 --> 00:09:02,384

Now,

30
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:21,153
before the occupation,
there were four Jewish
families in this area,

and the Dreyfuses.

34
00:09:34,167 --> 00:09:35,709
Is that correct?

35
00:09:35,794 --> 00:09:36,794
To my knowledge,

36
00:09:36,878 --> 00:09:40,339
those were the Jewish families
among the dairy farmers.

37
00:09:40,507 --> 00:09:44,343
Herr Colonel,
would it disturb you
if I smoked my pipe?

this is your house,

40
00:09:49,307 --> 00:09:52,268
Now, according
to these papers,

41
00:09:53,186 --> 00:09:56,605
all the Jewish families
in this area have been
accounted for

42
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:59,525
except the Dreyfuses.

43
00:10:00,986 --> 00:10:04,405
Somewhere in the last year
it would appear
they've vanished.

44
00:10:04,489 --> 00:10:07,783
Which leads me
to the conclusion that they've
either made good their escape

45
00:10:07,867 --> 00:10:10,786
or someone
is very successfully
hiding them.

46
00:10:11,997 --> 00:10:15,624
What have you heard
about the Dreyfuses,
monsieur LaPadite?

47
00:10:15,709 --> 00:10:16,667

so misleading,

where rumors,
true or false,
are often revealing.

00:10:24,634 --> 00:10:26,093

(THAN KING

91
00:13:28,902 --> 00:13:30,444
That they call you
"The Jew H unter."

92
00:13:30,528 --> 00:13:32,070
Precisely.

93
00:13:34,407 --> 00:13:37,034
I understand
your trepidation
in repeating it.

94
00:13:37,118 --> 00:13:39,411
Heydrich apparently
hates the moniker

95

the good people of Prague
have bestowed on him.

96
00:13:42,248 --> 00:13:45,501
Actually, why he would hate
the name "the Hangman"
is baffling to me.

97
00:13:45,585 --> 00:13:48,921
lt would appear he has
done everything in
his power to earn it.

98
00:13:49,005 --> 00:13:52,257
Now I, on the other hand,
love my unofficial title

99
00:13:52,342 --> 00:13:54,760
precisely because
I've earned it.

100
00:13:56,179 --> 00:14:00,224
The feature that makes me
such an effective hunter
of the Jews is,

101
00:14:00,308 --> 00:14:03,018
as opposed to most
German soldiers,

102
00:14:03,102 --> 00:14:05,103
I can think like a Jew

103
00:14:05,772 --> 00:14:08,482
where they can only
think like a German.

104
00:14:08,858 --> 00:14:11,276
(CHUCKLING) More precisely,
a German soldier.

105
00:14:17,951 --> 00:14:22,913
Now, if one were to determine
what attribute the German
people share with a beast,

106
00:14:23,456 --> 00:14:27,000
it would be the cunning
and the predatory instinct
of a hawk.

107
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:31,296
But if one were to determine
what attributes the Jews share
with a beast,

108
00:14:31,381 --> 00:14:33,507
it would be
that of the rat.

109
00:14:36,302 --> 00:14:40,138
The Führer and Goebbels'
propaganda have said
pretty much the same thing.

110
00:14:40,223 --> 00:14:43,225
But where our conclusions
differ,

111
00:14:43,309 --> 00:14:46,311
is I don't consider
the comparison an insult.

112
00:14:48,815 --> 00:14:52,651
Consider for a moment
the world a rat lives in.

113
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:55,779
It's a hostile world,
indeed.

Has a rat ever done
anything to you

to create this animosity
you feel toward them?

They bite people.

Rats were the cause
of the bubonic plague,
but that's some time ago.

121
00:15:18,303 --> 00:15:20,929
I propose to you any disease
a rat could spread,

122
00:15:21,014 --> 00:15:23,473
a squirrel could
equally carry.

123
00:15:23,558 --> 00:15:25,142
Would you agree?

(AGREES IN FRENCH)

125
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:29,605
Yet, I assume you don't
share the same animosity
with squirrels

126
00:15:29,689 --> 00:15:31,690

do you?

127
00:15:31,774 --> 00:15:32,774
No.

128
00:15:32,859 --> 00:15:35,360
Yet, they're both rodents,
are they not?

129
00:15:35,445 --> 00:15:39,448
And except for the tail,
they even rather look alike,
don't they?

130
00:15:39,866 --> 00:15:42,701
It's an interesting thought,
Herr Colonel.

131
00:15:43,411 --> 00:15:45,454
However interesting
as the thought may be,

132
00:15:45,538 --> 00:15:48,790
it makes not
one bit of difference
to how you feel.

133
00:15:51,127 --> 00:15:55,213
If a rat were
to walk in here,
right now, as I'm talking

134
00:15:56,341 --> 00:16:00,177
would you greet it
with a saucer
of your delicious milk?

135
00:16:00,261 --> 00:16:01,720
Probably not.

136
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:04,097
I didn't think so.

137
00:16:04,724 --> 00:16:06,266
You don't like them.

138
00:16:06,351 --> 00:16:08,226
You don't really know
why you don't like them.

139
00:16:08,311 --> 00:16:11,063
All you know is
you find them repulsive.

140
00:16:13,274 --> 00:16:16,318
Consequently,
a German soldier
conducts a search

141
00:16:16,402 --> 00:16:18,945
of a house suspected
of hiding Jews.

142
00:16:19,864 --> 00:16:21,448
Where does the hawk look?

143
00:16:21,532 --> 00:16:24,701
He looks in the barn,
he looks in the attic,
he looks in the cellar,

144
00:16:24,786 --> 00:16:27,245
he looks everywhere
he would hide.

145
00:16:28,206 --> 00:16:32,376
But there are so many places
it would never occur
to a hawk to hide.

146
00:16:34,629 --> 00:16:38,298
However, the reason
the Führer has brought me
off my Alps in Austria

147
00:16:38,383 --> 00:16:42,803
and placed me in
French cow country today is
because it does occur to me.

148
00:16:44,055 --> 00:16:47,391
Because I'm aware
what tremendous feats
human beings are capable of

149
00:16:47,475 --> 00:16:49,518
once they abandon dignity.

150
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:53,438
May I smoke my pipe
as well?

151
00:16:55,775 --> 00:16:58,652
Please, Herr Colonel,
make yourseIf at home.

152
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:16,461
Now, my job dictates

153
00:17:21,801 --> 00:17:24,469
that I must have my men
enter your home

154
00:17:28,391 --> 00:17:30,267
and conduct
a thorough search

155
00:17:30,351 --> 00:17:34,146
before I can officially
cross your family's name
off my list.

156
00:17:34,897 --> 00:17:38,775
And if there are any
irregularities to be found,
rest assured they will be.

157
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:41,069
That is unless you have
something to tell me

158
00:17:41,154 --> 00:17:44,197
that makes the conducting
of a search unnecessary.

159
00:17:44,282 --> 00:17:46,533
I might add, also,
that any information

160
00:17:46,617 --> 00:17:51,288
that makes the performance
of my duty easier will not
be met with punishment.

161
00:17:52,123 --> 00:17:55,667
Actually, quite the contrary.
It will be met with reward.

162
00:17:56,169 --> 00:17:57,461
And that reward will be,

163
00:17:57,545 --> 00:18:00,338
your family will cease
to be harassed in any way

164
00:18:00,423 --> 00:18:04,843
by the German military
during the rest of our
occupation of your country.

165
00:18:15,521 --> 00:18:18,857
You're sheltering enemies
of the state, are you not?

166
00:18:24,197 --> 00:18:25,280
Yes.

167
00:18:28,201 --> 00:18:32,120
You're sheltering them
underneath your floorboards,
aren't you?

168
00:18:34,665 --> 00:18:35,707
Yes.

169
00:18:38,544 --> 00:18:41,588
Point out to me the areas
where they're hiding.

170
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:03,985
Since I haven't heard
any disturbance,

01:05:36,693 --> 01:05:40,529
And the second one was called
Twenty-Four Frame da Vinci.

515
01:05:40,614 --> 01:05:45,951
It's a subtextual film
criticism study of the work
of German director G.W. Pabst.

516
01:05:46,453 --> 01:05:48,037
What should we
drink to, sir?

517
01:05:48,121 --> 01:05:49,371
Well...

518
01:05:50,624 --> 01:05:52,583
Down with Hitler.

519
01:05:52,667 --> 01:05:54,043
All the way down, sir.

520
01:05:54,419 --> 01:05:55,669
Yes.

521
01:05:59,382 --> 01:06:03,469
Are you familiar
with German cinema
under the Third Reich?

522
01:06:05,347 --> 01:06:09,558
Yes. Obviously, I haven't
seen any of the films made
in the last three years,

523
01:06:09,643 --> 01:06:11,894
but I'm familiar with it.

524
01:06:11,978 --> 01:06:13,020
Explain it to me.

525
01:06:13,688 --> 01:06:14,730
Pardon, sir?

526
01:06:14,814 --> 01:06:19,068
Well, this little escapade
of ours requires a knowledge
of the German film industry

527
01:06:19,152 --> 01:06:24,323
under the Third Reich.
Explain to me U FA
under Goebbels.

528
01:06:26,493 --> 01:06:28,869
GoebbeIs considers
the films he's making

529
01:06:28,953 --> 01:06:32,206
to be the beginning
of a new era
in German cinema.

530
01:06:32,666 --> 01:06:34,333
An alternative
to what he considers

531
01:06:34,417 --> 01:06:37,378
the Jewish-German
intellectual cinema
of the '20s,

532
01:06:38,088 --> 01:06:40,756
and the Jewish-controlled
dogma of Hollywood.

533
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:42,424
How's he doing?

534
01:06:42,967 --> 01:06:45,552
Frightfully sorry, sir.
Once again?

535
01:06:46,012 --> 01:06:50,599
You say he wants
to take on the Jews
at their own game.

536
01:06:51,601 --> 01:06:54,603
Well, compared to,
say, Louis B. Mayer,

537
01:06:55,438 --> 01:06:57,690
how's he doing?

538
01:06:57,774 --> 01:06:59,024
Quite well, actually.

539
01:06:59,693 --> 01:07:01,276
Since Goebbels
has taken over,

540
01:07:01,361 --> 01:07:05,781
film attendance has steadily
risen in Germany over
the last eight years.

541
01:07:05,865 --> 01:07:09,326
But Louis B. Mayer
wouldn't be Goebbels'
proper opposite number.

542
01:07:09,411 --> 01:07:13,205
I believe Goebbels
sees himseIf closer
to David O. Selznick.

543
01:07:17,627 --> 01:07:19,002
Brief him.

544
01:07:19,337 --> 01:07:24,383
Lieutenant H icox, at this
point and time I'd like to
brief you on Operation Kino.

545
01:07:24,968 --> 01:07:26,093
Three days from now

546
01:07:26,177 --> 01:07:30,514
Joseph GoebbeIs is throwing
a gala premiere of one
of his new movies in Paris.

547
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:31,724
What film, sir?

548
01:07:31,808 --> 01:07:34,476
The motion picture is
called Nation's Pride.

549
01:07:35,437 --> 01:07:38,814
In attendance
at this joyous
Germatic occasion

550
01:07:38,898 --> 01:07:43,318
will be Goebbels, Goring,
Bormann, and most of
the German H igh Command

551
01:07:43,403 --> 01:07:47,156
including all high ranking
officers of both
the SS and the Gestapo,

552
01:07:47,240 --> 01:07:50,659
as well as luminaries
of the Nazi propaganda
film industry.

553
01:07:50,744 --> 01:07:52,828
The master race at play?

554
01:07:52,912 --> 01:07:57,082
Basically, we have
all our rotten eggs
in one basket.

555
01:07:57,167 --> 01:07:59,710
The objective
of Operation Kino,

556
01:08:00,628 --> 01:08:02,379
blow up the basket.

557
01:08:03,173 --> 01:08:07,259
And like the snows
of yesteryear,
gone from this earth.

558
01:08:08,178 --> 01:08:09,845
Jolly good, sir.

559
01:08:10,597 --> 01:08:14,099
An American Secret Service
outfit that lives deep
behind enemy lines

560
01:08:14,184 --> 01:08:15,726
will be your assist.

561
01:08:15,810 --> 01:08:19,688
The Germans call them
the Basterds.

562
01:08:20,231 --> 01:08:23,442
The Basterds.
Never heard of them.

563
01:08:23,610 --> 01:08:26,445
Whole point of
the Secret Service, old boy,
you not hearing of them.

564
01:08:26,529 --> 01:08:30,532
But the Jerries have heard
of them, because these Yanks
have been them the devil.

565
01:08:30,617 --> 01:08:35,329
You'll be dropped into France,
about 24 kilometers outside
of Paris.

566
01:08:35,413 --> 01:08:37,498
The Basterds
will be waiting for you.

567
01:08:37,582 --> 01:08:40,334
First thing, you'll go
to a little village
called Nadine.

568
01:08:41,461 --> 01:08:44,254
In Nadine,
there's a tavern
called La Louisiane.

569
01:08:44,339 --> 01:08:47,508
There you'll rendezvous
with our double agent.
She'll take it from there.

570
01:08:47,592 --> 01:08:49,718
She's the one who
is going to get you
into the premiere.

571
01:08:49,803 --> 01:08:53,555
It'll be you, her,
and two German-born
members of the Basterds.

572
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:57,059
She's also made
all the other arrangements
you're going to need.

573
01:08:57,894 --> 01:08:59,061
How will I know her?

574
01:08:59,187 --> 01:09:02,397
I suspect
that won't be too much
trouble for you.

575
01:09:03,483 --> 01:09:06,401
Your contact
is Bridget von Hammersmark.

576
01:09:06,486 --> 01:09:07,945
Bridget von Hammersmark?

577
01:09:09,197 --> 01:09:12,199
(CHUCKLING)
The German movie star
is working for England?

578
01:09:12,283 --> 01:09:14,868
Yes, for the last
two years now.

579
01:09:14,953 --> 01:09:18,497
One could even say
that Operation Kino
was her brainchild.

580
01:09:18,581 --> 01:09:19,748
Indeed.

581
01:09:19,833 --> 01:09:20,874
Got the gist?

582
01:09:20,959 --> 01:09:23,710
I think so, sir.
Paris when it sizzles.

583
01:09:27,841 --> 01:09:31,343
You didn't say
the goddamn rendezvous is
in a fucking basement.

584
01:09:31,427 --> 01:09:32,761
I didn't know.

585
01:09:32,846 --> 01:09:34,263
You said it was
in a tavern.

586
01:09:34,347 --> 01:09:35,514
It is a tavern.

587
01:09:35,598 --> 01:09:36,974
Yeah, in a basement.

588
01:09:37,642 --> 01:09:40,519
You know,
fighting in a basement
offers a lot of difficulties.

589
01:09:40,603 --> 01:09:43,897
N umber one being,
you're fighting
in a basement.

590
01:09:43,982 --> 01:09:45,858
What if we go in there
and she's not even there?

591
01:09:45,942 --> 01:09:47,192
We wait.

592
01:09:48,027 --> 01:09:52,114
Don't worry.
She's a British spy.
She'll make the rendezvous.

593
01:10:13,636 --> 01:10:15,971
Stiglitz, right?

594
01:10:16,055 --> 01:10:17,097
That's right, sir.

595
01:10:18,349 --> 01:10:20,851
I hear you're pretty good
with that.

596
01:10:24,647 --> 01:10:27,774
You know, we're not looking
for trouble right now.

597
01:10:28,026 --> 01:10:31,570
Simply making contact
with our agent.
Should be uneventful.

598
01:10:33,406 --> 01:10:38,285
However,
the off chance I'm wrong,
things prove eventful,

599
01:10:39,495 --> 01:10:42,414
I need to know
we can all remain calm.

600
01:10:47,128 --> 01:10:48,545
I don't look calm to you?

601
01:10:49,380 --> 01:10:50,631
(LAUGHS)

602
01:10:51,507 --> 01:10:56,386

you put it like that,
l guess you do.

603
01:11:11,527 --> 01:11:17,324

Stiglitz, not exactly
the loquacious type, is he?

01:11:19,160 --> 01:11:22,871
Is that
the kind of man you need?
Loquacious type?

605
01:11:24,624 --> 01:11:27,167
Fair point, Lieutenant.

606
01:11:29,462 --> 01:11:32,214
So you all
get in trouble in there,
what are we supposed to do?

607
01:11:32,298 --> 01:11:34,508

on how it all comes out?

608
01:11:35,718 --> 01:11:38,887
If we get into trouble,
we can handle it.

609
01:11:40,390 --> 01:11:43,308
But if trouble does happen,
we need you to make damn sure

610
01:11:43,393 --> 01:11:47,562
no Germans, or French,
for that matter,
escape from that basement.

611
01:11:48,481 --> 01:11:52,734

cover is compromised,
the mission is kaput.

612
01:11:53,069 --> 01:11:58,740
Speaking of Frau von
Hammersmark, whose idea was it
for the deathtrap rendezvous?

613
01:11:59,742 --> 01:12:01,159
She chose the spot.

614
01:12:01,244 --> 01:12:02,869
Isn't that just dandy?

615
01:12:02,954 --> 01:12:06,915

She's just an actress.

She wasn't picking
a place to fight.

618
01:12:13,339 --> 01:12:16,133

1013
02:07:47,670 --> 02:07:51,882
since Hitler's death
or possible rescue rests
solely on my reaction,

1014

if I do nothing,

1015
02:07:54,552 --> 02:07:57,262
it's as if
I'm causing his death
even more than yourselves.

1016
02:07:57,347 --> 02:07:58,597
Wouldn't you agree?

1017
02:07:59,265 --> 02:08:00,599
I guess so.

I guess so, too.

1020
02:08:12,445 --> 02:08:13,695

l have no intention

1021
02:08:13,780 --> 02:08:16,865
of killing Hitler and killing
GoebbeIs and killing Goring
and killing Bormann,

1022
02:08:16,949 --> 02:08:19,701

the war single-handedly
for the Allies,

to find myself standing
